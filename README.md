# multipaste

information:

Windows only, uses pywin32 for clipboard since copying multiple files in
explorer uses a different format for the data (a list of files) other
than plain text.

It is for pasting multiple files from explorer. It uses the extension to
determine which import operator to use on each file.  Currently
supported: SVG OBJ DAE PLY
